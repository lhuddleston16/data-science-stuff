- 👋 Hi, I’m Levi Huddleston
- I enjoy solving difficult problems related to MLOps. With a background in data engineering, data science, and CI/CD pipelines, I can create an end-to-end solution to find accurate and meaningful outcomes with your data.

- As a consultant most of my coding does not lend itself to be used on a public Github, however there are a few examples of work I can share that I developed outside client work. These html files can be downloaded and opened in the browser!

Expertise:
- CI/CD / Gitlab / Puppet
- Data Science & Engineering
- Code quality -unit testing, lintings, etc
- ML AWS Certified
- Sagemaker
- Databricks
- Redshift / Snowflake
